# Stay Alive!

### *Stay Alive!* is a fun app with an apocalyptic twist designed to gamify your life. Create your own avatar and make those boring old chores and tasks you dread into something worthwhile! Reward yourself for taking out the trash, going to the gym all week, or even taking your car to get an oil change. Defend yourself with a baseball bat, sport some nice shades, and even unlock a set of chainmail armor to protect you from dangers of the wasteland. Life is not fair (especially in the apocalypse)! Will you stay on task and survive?

## Motivation
The motivation for Stay Alive came from a few memberâ€™s backgrounds as casual gamers, passion for organization, and love for zombies. By Gamifying todo lists and providing a risk/reward system the user can risk not completing their tasks and suffering the wrath of the zombie horde or they can push themselves to reach their goals and be rewarded for doing so. Stay Alive is meant to enable the user to build better habits while providing some feedback to their progress and consistency through the statistics and charts.  It's completely customizable to suit anyone, by not forcing a set range of tasks upon the user they are able to refine their tasks/todos to perfectly match what they really need to do each day, week and month. By not arbitrarily assigning categories or trying to predetermine what the tasks should be they have the freedom to play as much as they'd like to and could eliminate the use of other todo list type systems to see the maximum benefit of keeping them all in one place and Staying Alive with us. We hope to provide a social platform aspect to the app in the future so you can Stay Alive with your friends by joining parties and completing group tasks together. 
Please enjoy using and hopefully benefit from our application.
